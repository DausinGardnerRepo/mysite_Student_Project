# mysite_Student_Project

#This project was a student project I completed in 2022.
#I studied and learned the languages HTML/CSS and WebDNA within about a month time period while simultaneously developing this website
#Most of this will likely be confusing as WebDNA is not a well known language

#However, if you look through the files you will see I implement:
#A database structure and interactive admin forms for non-programmer use after site construction
#And custom HTML/CSS templates, animations, and multiple navigational choices dependent on variable settings
