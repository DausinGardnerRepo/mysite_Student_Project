								Conceived in the late 1980s as a succesor to the ABC Language by Guido van Rossum, Python was a language designed for simplicity and quick-implementation times.

								<br>

								Created and published by Tim Peters in 1999, the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python">Zen of Python</a> document lists FIVE core prinicples to the philosphy of Python:
									<ol class ="development_desc">
										<li>
											Beautiful is better than ugly
										</li>

										<br>

										<li>
											Explicit is better than implicit
										</li>

										<br>

										<li>
											Simple is better than complex

											Complex is better than complicated

								Implementation and Maintennace
							</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>
										In December of 1989, Python's implementation into various company systems and was later on released onto open-source websites such as Github. Five years later, in 1994, the main forumn for Python-related discussion, known as <a href = "https://wiki.python.org/moin/CompLangPython">comp.lang.python</a>, was created.
									</p>

									<p>
										The main feature that attracts people to Python is it's community, of which all members consistently work together to create <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/libraries-in-python/">libraries</a> and features that would sometimes be added by van Rossum to the lanuage itself.
									</p>

									<p>
										Having served as the head developer and BDFL of Python for well over 30 years, van Rossum stepped down from his title on July 12th, 2018. The community reacted quickly to this surpsiing announcement, democratically electing a <a href = "https://realpython.com/lessons/python-steering-council/">Python Steering Council</a> that consists of FIVE members. The members currently serving on this community-organized board are:
											<ul>
												<li>
													<a href = "https://barry.warsaw.us">Barry Warsaw</a>
												</li>

												<li>
													<a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/drbrettcannon/?originalSubdomain=ca">Brett Cannon</a>

												<li>
													<a href = "https://twitter.com/ncoghlan_dev?lang=en">Nick Coghlan</a>
												</li>
											</ul>

											<p>
												All of these people hold meetings to discuss issues in the community, and will have the final say on adding any new features or implementing fixes to problems brought up in Python forums.

									<p class = "culture_text">
										The culture of Python is by far it's biggest strength. Through internet memes and platforms such as Github, Reddit, Discord, and Stack Overflow, Python has cultivated a following of professional and noob programmers alike. The simplicity of Python helps to keep the community fresh, with new users constantly pouring in trying to learn their first programming language.
									</p>

									<p class = "culture_text">
										There are two major types of Python users, the majority who use Python 3.0(Also known as Python 3000 or Py3k), and the smaller but vocal portion that use Python 2.x.
									</p>

									<p class = "culture_text">
										These factions were created due to the major relase of Python 3.0 on December 3rd, 2008. This release served to massively cull duplicate constructs, modules, and functions, having been noted as a return to the Zen of Python. 
									</p>

									<p class = "culture_text">
										Due to the massive amounts of reworking that needed to be done to simplify this version of Python, backwards-compatibility with older versions was broken entirely. this means that entire programs running off of Python 2.x would no longer function if upgraded to Python 3.0
									</p>

									<p class = "culture_text">
										By that point in time tens of thousands of programs were running off of Python! Meaning that, for a large majority of programmers, upgrading became much more of a pain than it was seemingly worth. Python 3.0 didn't offer them any new features, quite the opposite in fact, most libraries written for Python 2.x were never upgraded by their authors, meaning that a lot of people had no choice but to simply keep their older programs in the legacy version.
