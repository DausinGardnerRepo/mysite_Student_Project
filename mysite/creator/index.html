					Who Created Python?!
				</h1>
					<ul>
						<p>
						Python was developed and released by Dutch programmer Gudio van Rossum, with the main goal of it's creation being to stave off his boredom during the Christmas holidays, a time when his work offices would be closed.
						</p>

						<p>
							Originally created in 1989, this passion project was started by Van Rossum in the hopes of marketing it as a successor to ABC. Over the years Python was slowly built on as a language focused around two ideals:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li> 
								Simplicity
							</li>

							<br>

							<li> 
								Being open-source
							</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
							It wasn't until 1989 that Van Rossum secured funding for Python from the Defense Advanced Resarch Projects Agency of the United States government.

					<p>
						Guido van Rossum, born January 31st, 1956, is a renowned Programmer originally known for his work developing the ABC Programming language in January of 1987 at the Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica. Even to this day, Van Rossum cherishes his time spent on the project, calling it the sole reason for Python's creation, as he states...
