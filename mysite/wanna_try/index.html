			<h1>
				What is an IDE?
			</h1>
				<ul>
					<p>
						IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment, it essentially packages all the basic tools a programmer needs to write, test, and debug code into one platform. There are DOZENS of IDE programs to choose from, but the one I will be reccomending to you is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows">Visual Studio Code</a>.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Why?
					</h2>
					<p>
						Visual Studio Code is OVERKILL for a new programmer to say the least. It contains thousands upon thousands of extensions that allow for extensive customization of an individual programmer's workspace. 
					</p>
					<p>
						BUT, with the right tutorials and explanatnions, a newer programmer can set up Python easily and contain themselves to that workspace if they so chose. With introducing them to Visual Studio Code immediately, it will allow for the programmer to slowly branch out as they see fit.
					</p>
					<p>
						I personally have grown accustomed to many of it's useful extensions, such as Live Share that allows the programmer to work simultaneously with others to code remotely on a single file. These are things I have come to rely on as a beginner coder, and I hope that any who see this page can also get past the initial shock of so many options at once in order to harvest the long term benefits of those options.

				The How

			<p class="now_side">
				Now its time to teach you HOW Python works! To the right side will be a list of resources that I have personally used to learn Python. Please note that these are listed in order of advancement, meaning that items located towards the bottom of the list will rely on knowledge gained from those at the top.
			</p>
			<p class="now_side">
				This list of resources is for people already aware of basic computer programming concepts such as syntax, what it means to be an indentation language, and how to navigate/organize your files. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I will also expect you to have followed the tutorial above on how to set up an IDE, however do not worry if you are not using VS Code, as none of these resources are enviornment-specific.
			</p>
			<p class="now_side">
				If you are unfamiliar with the first two concepts, I would reccomend looking into <a href ="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Python_Concepts">Wikiversity's List of Python Concepts</a> and watching the first few videos from <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VElWbND-zg&list=PLZPZq0r_RZOOkUQbat8LyQii36cJf2SWT">Bro Code's Python Tutorial</a>.

				<h3>
					Practice:
				</h3>
					<p>
						The path to learning a programming language is not unlike that of "real" languages such as French or Spanish, as they both are focused around the same thing, communication. In this case, it is learning to communicate with a machine rather than other people.
					</p>
					<p>
						This means the key to learning Python is PRACTICE. The list below contains both project ideas, websites that will provide you <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-Leetcode">LEETCODE-style</a> problems to solve for points in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">gamified</a> system, and straight-forward exercises with linked solutions.

				What Are My Options?
			</h1>
			<h3>
				There are 3 main paths to advance your programming knowledge:
			</h3>
			<h2>
				Bootcamp
			</h2>
				<ul>
					<p>
						The shortest but most difficult path, <a href="http://thefirehoseproject.com/developer-guide/1">bootcamps</a> are programs either completed remotely at home or in a physical location where beginner programmers will work dilligently to retain mass amounts of information in a short 6-8 month span.
					</p>
					<p>
						These camps often encourage team-based problem-solving, where people of different skillsets will be grouped and made to collaborate on a single high-difficulty project. However it is important to note that the strategy and intensity of these camps vary wildly between each instance.
					</p>
					<p>
						These programs are extreme, but have been proven to be an effective way to grow one's skills massively. If you feel as though you have the dedication required, I strongly encourage you at least attempt a shorter, 3-month camp.
				</ul>
			<h2>
				College
			</h2>
				<ul>
					<p>
						By far the most traditional and reliable path, a college degree is the most sure-fire way to guarantee high quality education and work after graduation. The most common issues with this path come with length and cost, even the cheapest New York SUNY degree costs over 27k per semester for an on-campus freshmen student. Obviously, these costs are cut by things such as Community College transfers, scholarships, and FAFSA student loans.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are many majors to choose from when taking this path:
					</p>
						<li>
							Computer Science: The most common degree to attain for programmers, over 72% of Software Engineers hold this degree or one similar to it. Majoring in this will come with a main focus on software and theoretical discussion, with a side focus on mathematics.
						</li>
						<li>
							Computer Engineering: If you are more interested in the hardware side of technology, this degree focuses on the technical side of CPUs, Memory Management, Graphics, and Internal Processing. This degree is generally considered more difficult, but can also be more awarding when it comes to finding internships or on-campus work.
						</li>
						<li>
							Data Science: Out of all the majors listed, this one will be the most difficult. The courses for this degree focus on statistics, analytical data, database management, and how to conduct scientific studies. If you're interested in helping create advanced strategy models for businesses and solving scientific issues through analytics, this is the degree for you.
						</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>
				Self-Study
			</h2>
				<ul>
					<p>
						This is the most relaxed path for any programmer to take, but also requires high levels of concentration and a desire to learn. Self-study will not guarantee you a job in a high-paying field, but can land you entry level positions in analytics and menial task automation.
					</p>
					<p>
						The most attractive benefit to this path is that it is free, as the internet is filled with resources such as <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, and <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com"> Automate The Boring Stuff</a>. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Even this website is an example of a free resource! You've learned the entire history, pros/cons, accomplishments, and future of Python, for free! It's the hard work of people like me who are passionate about spreading knowledge that will allow you to spread your proverbial wings and soar to greater technological heights than ever imagine before by humankind.
					</p>
					<p>
						All I ask of you is that you use the information given to you today and spread it unto others, there are millions of potential programmers out there who just don't know where to start. Who knows, you could be helping along the next of our Corporate Overlords, and who doesn't love being rich by the virtue of Nepotism!
