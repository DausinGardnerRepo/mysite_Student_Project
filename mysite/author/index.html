				Who Am I?

					My name is Dausin, I am a beginner Python, HTML &amp; CSS, and WebDNA programmer. I strive to study the theory behind computers and the way software interacts with hardware.

				<p class ="bottom_border">
					I chose to create this website in the hopes that I can educate non-programmers, and maybe even encourage a few to enter the world of coding.

				Why Python?
			</h2>
				<p class = "who_text">
					Python was my personal introduction to coding. It served as a good distraction during dark times and allowed me to utilize the endless well of creativity I have never felt artistic enough to enact upon.
				</p>
				<p class ="bottom_border">
					Python also happens to be one of the easiest languages to introduce to the average person. It's popularity guarantees that most people have heard of it, meaning it's alos more likely to interest non-programmers idly scrolling.

			<h3>
				What Are My Plans For This Site?
			</h3>
				<p>
					I hope to keep this site as static as possible, a sort of relic of Python's story. This is why I chose this archaic layout, the colors call back to a simpler time that Python helped to build!

			<h3>
				What Are My Plans For The Future?
			</h3>
				<p>
					I personally hope to go to college for Computer Science, where I can study the theory behind how systems of technology function.
				</p>
				<p>
					After college the next section of my life will be focused on entering the work force, where I hope I can gain enough money that I can spend my extra time focusing on personal projects and gathering knowledge.
