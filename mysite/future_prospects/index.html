			Will Python Become Obsolete?

				<p>
					Let's get the simple stuff out of the way first.
				</p>
				<p> 
					No, Python will not become obsolete in the future nor is it obsolete now. The consensus I have found through various <a href ="https://pythoncorner.online/python-in-2022-will-it-die/">articles</a>, <a href = "https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-Python">forums</a>, and personal conversations is that Python's future calls for expansion more than anything else.

				Python's Future in AI
			</h2>
				<ul>
					<p>
						Artifical Intelligence is an ever-growing field, with <a href ="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2017/09/10/how-artificial-intelligence-is-revolutionizing-business-in-2017/#7d4382c45463">23%</a> of all companies relying on it for their business processes. This number is only set to grow, as it has been predicted by expert analysis that the AI market will become a 190 BILLION dollar industry by 2025.
					</p>
					<h3>
						Where Does Python Come Into Play?
					</h3>
						<p>
							Due to it's rapid expanison and constant competition, the AI market relies heavily on quick development and advancement times. This means that Python has become integral to machine learning and AI algorithims, as it's ease-of-use and quick ouput allows for rapid and consistent coding structure.
						</p>
						<p>
							Simplicity is bliss in the world of AI, and Python is proof of concept that a programming language can be simple and long lived, with it's basic utiltiies actually proving to be helpful in the most complex of tasks.

			What Makes Python So Sustainable?
		</h2>
			<ul>
				<p class ="sustainable">
				While it is by nature a useful and easy to read language, Python has a much larger influence to thank for it's success:
				</p>

				<h3 class ="com_center">
				It's community
				</h3>

				<p class ="sustainable">
					The community of Python has existed for well over 25 years. This means there has been ample time for webistes such as <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python?tab=Votes">StackOverflow</a>, <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/">Reddit</a>, and <a href = "https://github.com/python">Github</a> to build up massive libraries of question solutions, community-oriented events, and free open-source modules for public consumption.
				</p>

				<p class ="sustainable">
					All of this is helped even further by the fact that FAANG comapnies such as Alphabet(Google), Apple, and Amazon all rely on Python for their backend data analysis and Machine Learning infastructure. Google in particular is known for their heavy support and use of the language due to their relationship with it's creator and Steering Council member, Guido Van Rossum.
