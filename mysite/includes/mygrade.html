		I feel like, with all of my work and admitted shortcomings, that my website is worth at least a 90%. My website was more functional than every other 1st years in most ways, and the only requirement that I feel I did not fully complete was the photos and images requirement. Not every page had a video/photo as Mac specified. However I do feel as though I went above and beyond the requirements, as even the Emails sent by my contact form have an HTML embed that matches the stylization of my website. So from an objective perspective, I believe anywhere from a 90%-100% would be fully reasonable.
